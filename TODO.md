- code_lib/graph_builder.py extensions:
    - Parallelize / Multithread timestep graphs - so we build couple time steps in parallel.
    - We might want to adjust the build_edge_index(...) method - maybe we want to have edge weights based on transaction value etc, sth to think abt.
    - Maybe we can get a speedup / simplify stuff if an illict edge means that the transaction involves an illicit node - we'd have to double check with the paper, for now the code doesn't make this assumption and possibly has a bunch of redundant checks and calculations because of that.

- Figure out a way to visualize the time-step graphs, was looking at Gephi (https://gephi.org/desktop/).
- Run more extensive comparisons between diff generation targets (so look at illicit and previously transacting with illicit or not, neighbourood sizes, time horizons) to make an informed decision abt our target. Started doing some basic comparisons with the compare_emergence_graphs.ipynb notebook. Would be nice to have some plots based on that.
- Train a GCN and EvolveGCN baselines on time-step graphs generated by graph_builder.py.
- Classify the "unknown" nodes to geta denser signal possibly.
- Figure out the TGN and fully continuous setup (if this version doesn;t do too well and if we have time i guess).
- Figure out the explainability aspect (maybe just spectral analysis of convolutio filters in EvolveGCN / GCN??).
