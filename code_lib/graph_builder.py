        keep_class_labels_as_features: bool, default=False
            If True, include node class labels as features (may cause label leakage)
            If False, exclude class labels from node features
        add_staleness_feature: bool, default=False
            If True, add a staleness feature (current_time_step - first_appearance_time) to node features
        ignore_illict: bool, default=True
            If True, nodes that are already illicit at time t receive default labels
            and are excluded from the positive label set, which means that if they will be
            a neighbour to a future illicit, that wont be counting towards their current
            neihbours positive labelling
        ignore_previously_transacting_with_illicit: bool, default=True
            If True, nodes with any illicit transaction history up to time t
            receive default labels and are excluded from the positive label set,
            which means that if they will be a neighbour to a future illicit, that
            wont be counting towards their current neihbours positive labelling
        profile: bool, default=False
            If True, print detailed timing information for each step (useful for debugging performance)
        cumulative: bool, default=False
            If True, builds a monotonically increasing grpah by iteratively adding the next timestep to the current graph.
            Otherwise, builds a seperate graph for each timestep
